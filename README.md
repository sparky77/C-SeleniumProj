## Project Overview
This repository contains a C# .NET project that uses Selenium for automated web testing. The project aims to ensure robust testing of web applications by automating interactions with web browsers, leveraging Selenium for browser automation.

## Framework and Technologies
- **.NET**: The project is built using the .NET framework, providing a comprehensive and consistent programming model for application development.
- **Selenium**: Employs Selenium for automating web browsers, simulating real user interactions with web pages.
- **NUnit**: Manages test cases and assertions to ensure the web application behaves as expected.

## GitHub Actions Integration
The project integrates with GitHub Actions to enable continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) through workflows defined in YAML (.yml) files. This automation streamlines the build process, testing, and deployment activities following commits to the repository.

### Key Components of the GitHub Actions Workflow
- `actions/checkout`: Checks out the source code for the build.
- `actions/setup-dotnet`: Configures the .NET environment.
- `dotnet build`: Compiles the application.
- `dotnet test`: Executes the NUnit tests to validate web application functionality.
- **Artifact Upload**: Successful tests capture results as artifacts, accessible in GitHub Actions logs.

## Continuous Feedback and Quality Assurance
Leveraging GitHub Actions, the project maintains high-quality standards with each integration, providing immediate feedback on the effects of recent changes. This CI/CD pipeline ensures quick detection and resolution of integration errors, enhancing the application's stability and reliability.

## Getting Started
To run this project locally, you will need:
