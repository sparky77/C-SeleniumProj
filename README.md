Project Overview
This repository contains a C# .NET project that leverages Selenium for automated web testing. The project is designed to ensure robust testing of web applications by automating interactions with web browsers through Selenium, a powerful tool for web browser automation.

Framework and Technologies
.NET: The project is built using the .NET framework, which provides a comprehensive and consistent programming model for building applications.
Selenium: Used for automating web browsers, allowing the tests to simulate real user interactions with web pages.
NUnit: Employed for managing test cases and handling assertions, ensuring that the web application behaves as expected.
GitHub Actions Integration
The project is integrated with GitHub Actions, enabling continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) through workflows defined in a YAML (.yml) file. This setup automates the process of building the project, running tests, and deploying the application upon commits to the repository.

Key Components of the GitHub Actions Workflow
actions/checkout: Checks out the source code for the build.
actions/setup-dotnet: Configures the .NET environment.
dotnet build: Compiles the application.
dotnet test: Runs Selenium tests using NUnit to validate the functionality of the web application.
Artifact Upload: If tests are successful, test results are captured as artifacts and can be reviewed in the GitHub Actions logs.
Continuous Feedback and Quality Assurance
By leveraging GitHub Actions, the project maintains high standards of quality with each integration, providing immediate feedback on the impact of recent changes. This CI/CD pipeline ensures that any integration errors are caught early and can be addressed promptly, maintaining the stability and reliability of the application.
